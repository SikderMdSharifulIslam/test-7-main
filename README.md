<!--------------------- Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project. ------------------->

Question-2:
-->I will discuss about two hooks in the React library.

    a. useState() : It returns an array containing two values (1) which is the variable name, first its value in the state (if any default value is given) then its value is updated by the 2nd function.
    (2) Function : The value of the state is updated through this function.

    (b) useEffect () : Used to call any API or get any data. It contains two values, the first is the callback function, the second is the dependency. Data is gated through a callback function. And that data is updated through dependencies.
